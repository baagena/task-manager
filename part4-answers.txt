Part 4: Client Communication Scenario

1. A task is blocked and may delay delivery. How do you communicate this to the client? 

If a task is blocked and might cause a delay, I first try to understand the problem and see if there’s a way to fix it. Then, I tell the client as soon as possible. I explain what’s going on, why it’s happening, what we’re doing to fix it, and how it might affect the deadline. I also give a new timeline if needed. I stay in touch and give updates so the client knows I’m on top of it

2. You get simultaneous Slack messages from the client and your project manager. Who do 
you prioritize and why? 

I check both messages. If neither is super urgent, I reply to the project manager first, since they usually lead the communication and might already be handling the client. Then I follow up as needed.

3. How do you manage your time and stay productive while working remotely? 

I organize my day with a task list and clear priorities. I use tools to manage my time, avoid distractions, and take short breaks to stay focused. I also communicate often with my team to stay in sync
